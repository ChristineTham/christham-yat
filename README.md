# Hello Jekyll Starter

This is a starter for a personal blog/web site written in Markdown and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The site design was originally a fork of [Jekyll YAT Theme](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat), but I have converted to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). It relies on [jekyll-spaceship](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship) to provide various advanced features.
