<p>The surname Tham (譚) is pronounced and romanised differently in different languages and dialects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tan (Hokkien Chinese and Mandarin Chinese)</li>
  <li>Tan (Japanese)</li>
  <li>Dam (Korean)</li>
  <li>Đàm (Vietnamese)</li>
  <li>Tam (Cantonese Chinese and Hakka Chinese)</li>
  <li>Tham (Hokkien Chinese and Teochew Chinese)</li>
  <li>Ham, Hom, Hum, Tom, Thom (Toisanese Chinese)</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard Hanyu Pinyin romanisation is <strong>Tan</strong> and it is pronounced <em>Taam4</em> (Jyutping romanisation) in Cantonese.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_(surname)">Wikipedia</a>, it is the 56th most common Chinese surname.</p>

<h2 id="early-history">Early History</h2>

<p>The earliest known Tan is King Tan (Tan Gong 谭公) who appeared in the Book of Odes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Poetry">Shih-ching</a>. He ruled over the State of Sung (Sung kuo 宋國), married Zhuang Jiang (庄姜) and was appointed a Viscount in the Zhou (周) Dynasty. The surname Tan became a hereditary surname to be passed down to descendants. He also became known as Tan Zi.</p>

<p>King Tan established the Tan Kingdom, which was situated in the current Shandong Province Ji Nan (山东省济南) (Li City) (历城), 70 miles east South of Long Shan Township (龙山镇). That is about 2 miles east/north of the Long Shan Station of the Jiao Ji Railway Line (龙山胶济铁路). It is also name as Dong Ping Ling District (东平陵县) or Ping Ling District (平陵县). It was pronounced as a Royal Kingdom by Han Wen Di (汉文帝) after ruling it for 16 years.</p>

<p>However, the Kingdom was abolished when Tai Zong Zhen Guang from the State of Chü (齊國) defeated the Tan state. The descendants of the Tan family fled, mainly to the provinces of Guangdong and He Nan. The writing of the surname was also changed from 談 to 譚 to avoid pursuit by enemies.</p>

<h2 id="the-tham-clan">The Tham clan</h2>

<p>Today, there are over 1 million members of the Tan clan spread across the world, including Malaysia and Australia. Many Tan people identify as Taishanese (台山) or Sze Yup people (四邑廣東人).</p>

  <h3 id="478-tan2-譚">478. T’an2 譚</h3>

  <p>The surname T’an (譚) came from two sources: 1. Yüan ho hsing tsuan traces the origin of the surname T’an (譚) as follows: the surname derivd [sic] from the name of the feudal territory, the State of T’an (T’an kuo 譚國) in the Spring and Autumn (Ch’un ch’iu 春秋) Period. After the State of T’an was defeated by the State of Chü (齊國), its descendants formally adopted T’an as their common surname. The family initially settled in Shan-tung (山東) and later prospered in Hu-nan (湖南) provinces. 2. The surname T’an (譚) branched from the surname T’an (談) due to a change of character for the name to avoid revenge of the family by the rivals.</p>

  <h3 id="479-tan2-談">479. T’an2 談</h3>

  <p>The surname T’an (談) derived from the following two sources: 1. According to Ch’ien chia hsing, the eldest son of the Shang (商) king Ti-i (帝乙) whose name was Wei Tzu-ch’i (微子) ? was bestowed with the feudal territory of the State of Sung (Sung kuo 宋國) by Chou Wu-wang (周武王). Thirty-six generations later, the State of Sung was ruled by T’an Chün (談公) after he defeated the State of Ch’u (Ch’u kuo 楚國) and T’an was adopted as a common surname by his descendants. 2. The surname T’an follows the ancestral line of Chi T’an (籍談) who was a grand master (ta-fu 大夫) in the Chou (周) dynasty. His descendants initially adopted the surname T’an (談) but later changed to T’an (譚) after the family escaped from the homeland to avoid revenge by the rivals.</p>

  <p>Kapitan Cina, also spelled Kapitan China or Capitan China (English: Captain of the Chinese; Chinese: 華人甲必丹; pinyin: Huárén Jiǎbìdān; Dutch: Kapitein der Chinezen), was a high-ranking government position in the civil administration of colonial Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Borneo and the Philippines.

<p>The following is taken from an epitaph erected by The N.S. Tham Clansmen Association:</p>

<p><img src="/hello-jekyll/assets/images/DSCF2508.jpg" alt="Epitaph" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kapitan Tham Yong, also known as Tham Tuck Thong and Tham Onn Yong, was a Chinese leader in Negeri Sembilan during the late 19th Century.</p>

  <p>He was born in China during the end of the Ching Dynasty, he left his homeland in Dragon Mouth Village of Changsha Township by Kaiping District in the Province of GuangDong, and sailed to Malaya in search of a new life.</p>

  <p>As a humble and kind hearted man, he believed in honesty and the virtues of frugality. He worked his way to become a prominent tin miner in Seremban and was highly regarded by the British Colonial Government as well as the local community. As a result of this achievement, he was conferred a Chinese Kapitan. He died on on 8th August 1913 at the age of 57.</p>

  <p>Kapitan Tham Yong made significant contributions to the revolutionary affairs of Dr. Sun Yat Sen, in addition to the Chinese community in Negeri Sembilan. In his endeavors, he donated a piece of land at Jalan Temiang in Seremban to build the Chinese Maternity Hospital for the poor and needy. (The hospital was later converted to Wah Chai Association which handiest matters in relation to Chinese burial grounds.) He also donated one acre of land at Bukit Rase, Seremban to house a Chinese cemetery (now the main graveyard of the Tham Clan of HongYang); managed by the Tham Clan Association.</p>

  <p>After the independence of Malaya, the local Government changed the name of Murray Street in Seremban to Jalan Kapitan Tham Yong in honour of his numerous contributions to the country.</p>

  <p>With the consent of his descendants, The Tham Clansmen Association of Malaysia and The N.S. Tham Clansmen Association had decided to move the late Kapitan Tham Yong and his wife’s grave to the main burial ground of HongYang Tham Clan, thereby marking the area as a piece of homage for the future generation.</p>
