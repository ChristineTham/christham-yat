The Palace Gardens is part of the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney. It was the site of the massive Garden Palace that was built to house the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879-80. A catastrophic fire destroyed the Garden Palace in 1882.

We took a few photos here on the Leica M10, and it was an opportunity to teach Lyn how to focus on a rangefinder camera.

We also took a photo of the Autumn sculpture, located on the stairs leading away from the Palace Rose Garden towards the Calyx. I've always thought Autumn has great legs.
